 Hello! I’m Gerbovics Tamás. I am passionate about computers.

 In the past two years, I've been self-educated in programming, focused on Python, and written a software for my current employer to automate yearly biddings and some other processes.
 
 Now I'm on a government-financed course called "Nemzeti Struktúraváltó Képzés" and getting a qualification in system administrating. 

 My goal is to gain real-world experience and expand my knowledge. In addition, I've got previous work experience in the insurance industry and also have useful skills for contacting customers, handling compliance, and selling. My hobby is playing the bass.
